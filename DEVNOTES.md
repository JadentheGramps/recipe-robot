## Planned script workflow

Script takes the following as input:

- Input path, which can be one of the following
    - Path to an app
    - Path to an existing AutoPkg recipe
    - GitHub URL
    - SourceForge URL
    - Sparkle feed URL
    - Direct download URL
    - Others?
- Desired recipe identifier (e.g. com.github.homebysix)
- Desired recipe types (e.g. download, munki, pkg, etc.)
- Desired recipe save location
- For DeployStudio recipes, path to DS packages

And produces the following as output:

- One recipe for each selected recipe type that doesn't already exist
- A plist with meta-information about the recipe creation process, including errors

## Facts necessary to produce recipe types

These are the pieces of information we'll need to collect from app and recipe input in order to create the corresponding recipe types.

This may be useful when we create the various Recipe classes and subclasses.

- app_name
- bundle_id
- description
- developer
- download_format
- download_url
- github_repo
- max_os_vers
- min_os_vers

- codesign_reqs
- sourceforge_id
- sparkle_feed
- version_key

## Interesting examples and edge cases to use for testing:

Zip download reveals an installer in .app format:
`recipe-robot -v http://download.bjango.com/skalacolor/`

Sparkle feed blocks Python user-agent:
`recipe-robot -v http://bohemiancoding.com/static/download/sketch.zip`

Downloaded disk image requires agreement to license before mounting:
`recipe-robot -v https://www.revisionsapp.com/downloads/revisions-2.1.1.dmg`

Sparkle feed lists the most recent items last, instead of first:
`recipe-robot -v http://www.marinersoftware.com/sparkle/MacGourmet4/macgourmet4.xml`

Zip download reveals a pkg installer:
`recipe-robot -v http://download.bjango.com/istatserver/`

App that uses a version 1 (obsolete) code signature:
`recipe-robot -v http://mrrsoftware.com/Downloads/NameChanger/Updates/NameChanger-2_3_3.zip`

App that uses a LooseVersion (3.1.4.0) for CFBundleShortVersionString (also, specifies download format in URL parameters):
`recipe-robot -v https://srv3.airdroid.com/p14/web/getbinaryredirect?type=dmg`

Direct download doesn't work because of "SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE":
`recipe-robot -v http://www.macroplant.com/latest-binaries/adapter-mac.dmg`

The app we want is not at the root level of the downloaded file:
`recipe-robot -v https://github.com/jbtule/cdto/releases/download/2_6_0/cdto_2_6.zip`
`recipe-robot -v http://www.softobe.com/download/kinemac.dmg`
`recipe-robot -v http://www.softobe.com/download/flsy.dmg`

Download URL has `&` which doesn't parse in Terminal:
`recipe-robot -v http://www.dejal.com/download/?prod=simon&vers=4.1&lang=en&op=getnow&ref=footer`

The download produces a `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error:
`recipe-robot -v https://updates.aviatorbrowser.com/Aviator.dmg`

Direct download URL (dmg) is a different format than the Sparkle download URL (zip):
`recipe-robot -v https://tunnelblick.net/release/Tunnelblick_3.5.3_build_4270.4371.dmg --include-existing`


## App interface

Here's what we're thinking about for the app interface, for now:

1. Upon first launch, the user is prompted for a few pieces of information:

    - preferred identifier
    - preferred formats
    - path to save recipes to
    - (if DS) path to DS packages

    The user can get back to this screen at any time by choosing Preferences from the Recipe Robot menu.

    &nbsp;

2. Upon saving the preferences (and upon each subsequent launch), main window appears, prompting the user to drag in a recipe or app.

    ![app01.png](images/app01.png)

    &nbsp;

3. Upon dragging an app on, Recipe Robot starts processing facts about the app:

    1. Are there any existing AutoPkg recipes for this app?
    2. Does the app have a Sparkle feed? Is it valid?
    3. Is the app hosted on GitHub or SourceForge?

    ![app02.png](images/app02.png)

    &nbsp;

4. Recipes for all preferred formats possible are created by calling the Python scripts, and the resulting files are placed into a cache folder, which can be accessed by double-clicking.
