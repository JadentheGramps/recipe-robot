All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.


## [1.0.1] - 2015-12-28

- The script now displays a simple progress percentage during file downloads. (#24, #72)
- Added more [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK1ZziC_XFWoDnSYU3__WRQCRpXA2fhXq)!

### Fixed
- Adjusted colors so that they'll be more readable on both bright and dark backgrounds. (#79)

## [1.0] - 2015-11-17

## [0.2.5] - 2015-11-13

### Added
