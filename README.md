## Overview

Recipe Robot will soon become the easiest way to create AutoPkg recipes. It will consist of two components:

- __Python script__ that takes various types of input and automatically outputs AutoPkg recipes in various formats.

- A __native Mac app__ that puts a friendly face on the Python script and makes it as simple as dragging and dropping.

This two-pronged approach will allow AutoPkg novices to easily create recipes that follow community-accepted guidelines with the minimum amount of effort, and will still provide a command-line tool for more advanced AutoPkg users. Also, ensuring that all program logic is done in Python should hopefully foster community contribution to this project.

## Compatibility

My goal is not to make Recipe Robot generate perfect recipes 100% of the time. There will certainly be apps that Recipe Robot chokes on, and some recipe types are more complex to generate than others. I hope Recipe Robot will make the process of generating _standard_ recipes for _simple_ apps much faster and more consistent. The recipes generated by Recipe Robot should serve as a platform that you can customize before using and sharing.
